I am a visual learner and find it much easier to learn by seeing things,
than by imagining mathematical symbols in my mind.
Follow a mind map approach. Ask and answer What, Why, How.
Go easy on the math, focus on the practical parts.
Theory without code is not very helpful.


We will train our own Word2Vec from scratch
Its a compromise between technical correctness and ease of reading
No need to explictly define every thing, assume most people can understand word meaning form the context or a quick google search if needed, remember emphasis is on being fast.
